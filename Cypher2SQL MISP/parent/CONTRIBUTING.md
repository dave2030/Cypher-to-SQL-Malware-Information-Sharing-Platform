_How to become a contributor and submit your own code_

Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA.
If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA.

Please contact the team for instructions for how to get, sign and return it. 
Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

NOTE: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

**Contributing code**

If you have improvements to Cytosm, send us your pull requests! For those just getting started, Github has a howto.

If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the issues with the "Well-known" issues label. 
These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. 

If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.
